When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other people or coding with more than one computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is done so that we control the files, since there could be collaborators working on the codes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks copy another repository inside github, clone copy repository from remote to local or inside local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It can help synchronizing the commits

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Managing the differences between two codes with different authors would be harder, since there is no version control. It is easier if there is only one version and it is in a dropbox folder for example. However this has lack of version since the old file will be overwritten.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
