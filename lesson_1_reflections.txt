was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can see which code is better and continue working
    on it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Each commit will be logical and can be used for other
    addition.
    Cons: When a blackout happens then there will be lack of commits


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is used for coding, and some codes uses more than one file
    to run properly. Google docs on the other hand focuses on
    managing documents such as word, powerpoint, that does not
    need multiple file tracking.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    we can use the command by using the git log to see many versions of commit, and the updates.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can have multiple files, therefore we can trace back our mistake
    if we look at the versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
